{"name":"Pinner.js","body":"### Pinner.js\r\nThis is a simple jQuery plugin that puts pins into vertical columns, similiar to pinterest.com.\r\n\r\nThe key feature is that pins in each vertical column automatically adjust in height and keep their spacing between pins as the images of pins are loading. Sometimes, images can take a while to load in, which affects the height of the pins at the time the pins are assigned to the columns. With this plugin, as images are loaded, the columns just their vertical spacing, but DO NOT move pins from one column to another.\r\n\r\nTo remove the animations, just remove the CSS3 animation styles from the demo stylesheet.\r\n\r\nTo view this in action: [View the Demo](http://redronin.github.com/pinner.js/demos/demo1.html)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@redronin\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Simple jquery plugin for vertical column layout like pinterest.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
